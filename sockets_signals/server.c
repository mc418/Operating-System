The second program processor.c creates an output file secrets.out and waits for user input to be sent by the receiver program. As soon as one line is received from the receiver, it counts the number of digits in that line and dumps the digit count along with the original line in the secrets.out file. This program also runs in an infinite loop.

The processor.c will be the backend program â€“ call it server.c. 

The client and server programs have the same functionality as described in Assignment 3 except that they should use sockets as a communication mechanism that will allow the client and the server to be run on different machines.

When the user presses Ctrl-C on the server.c terminal, the server program should display a summary, which should show the number of lines received so far and the total digit count across all input seen by the server.
